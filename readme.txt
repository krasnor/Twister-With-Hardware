Use the sketch in ./conn_test_twister to test if your pads/fields are connected in the right order and recognize your gloves correctely.
Use the sketch in ./recognizeLimbs to test if your gloves are detected. You can modify the if-else statement if have used different resistor values for your gloves.

 Inside the ./gloves.ai you will find 2 stencils. The bigger one is the one for the feet, the other for the hands.

in ./images you will find some images from the twister field which may be helpful during construction.
Happy Building :)
